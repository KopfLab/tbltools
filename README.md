## Functionality

### iRAT/tRAT Generation

The [tbltools](https://kopflab.github.io/tbltools/) package provides
functionality to easily generate Readiness Assessment Tests from a
collection of questions and answers (including images and equations) and
any IF-AT answer key. For an example of how to use this functionality,
see the vignette on [Generating a Readiness Assessment
Test](https://kopflab.github.io/tbltools/articles/assessment_tests.html).

provides functionality to easily set up a peer evaluation server based
on a student roster and team assignments and then evaluate the collected
data. For an example of how to use this functionality, see the vignette
on [Peer
Evaluations](https://kopflab.github.io/tbltools/articles/peer_evaluations.html).
