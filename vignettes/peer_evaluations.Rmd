Peer Evaluations are an important component of the Team-Based Learning (TBL) style flipped classroom. However, they can be difficult to set up and evaluate because of the requirement for each team member to evaluate only their own team members and the amount of data generated in big classes. This package provides tools to set up a custom web-based peer evaluation application that can be hosted for free on RStudio's [shiny apps](http://www.shinyapps.io/) server (or any other shiny server) and allows each student to log in and enter evaluations for their teammates with a unique passcode. All evaluations are stored in a google spreadsheet only the instructor has access to (via their own google drive credentials) and the data can be aggregated easily using the tbltools package.

## Requirements

To generate and host a peer evaluation, you need the following:

 - R and a good RMarkdown editor ([RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is strongly recommended)
 - The [tbltools R package](https://kopflab.github.io/tbltools/)
 - A [google drive](https://drive.google.com) account
 - A [shiny apps](http://www.shinyapps.io/) account or other hosting solution for shiny apps
 
## Setup

To setup a peer evaluation:

 1. log into your google drive account and create a new empty google spreadsheet with a descriptive name (for example something like this: *class1234 peer evaluation 1*). This spreadsheet is where your peer evaluation data will be stored.
 1. load the `tbltools` library and run the `tbl_setup_peer_evaluation()` function with an (optional) name for the folder where you want the applicaton to be created (e.g. `folder = "peer eval 1"`), and the name of your google spreadsheet (e.g. `data_gs_title = "class1234 peer evaluation 1"`). The function uses the excellent [googlesheets](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets) package to step you through authenticating your google drive account interactively and will confirm that the google spreadsheet you linked can be accessed.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# make sure to start from scratch (i.e. delete peer eval 1 folder if it exists)
if (dir.exists("peer eval 1")) unlink("peer eval 1", recursive = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tbltools)
tbl_setup_peer_evaluation(folder = "peer eval 1", data_gs_title = "class1234 peer evaluation 1")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tbltools)
# create actual peer evaluation folder without credentials checks
tbl_setup_peer_evaluation(folder = "peer eval 1", data_gs_title = "class1234 peer evaluation 1", check_gs_access = FALSE)
cat(file = file.path("peer eval 1", "gs_token.rds"))
```

What just happened? tbltools created the `peer eval 1` folder and populated it with all the necessary files to launch a peer evaluation shiny application, which we will test locally in a moment. Let's take a look at what files were created first:

```{r}
list.files("peer eval 1", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
```

 - `app_...md`: these markdown files contain place-holder text for the peer evaluation application that you may want to customize to better reflect what you want the text in the peer evaluation to say. The format is of these files [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which is a simple text formatting language. 
 - `app.R`: this is the actual R script that launches the peer evaluation application. Take a look inside this file and modify the function call to fit your preferences (e.g. the title of the application, how many points per teammate, etc.) - see the help on the `?tbl_run_peer_evaluation` function for details on all available parameters.
 - `evaluation.Rmd`: this is a template [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file to evaluate the data collected during the peer evaluation. For examples of what the functions in this file do, see the [evaluation](#evaluation) section at the end of this document. Feel free to modify this evaluation file (or not use at all) as you see fit. 
 - `gs_token.rds`: this is an authentication token created with the [googlesheets](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets) package based on your google drive credentials that allows the peer evaluation application to write the students' responses to the google spreadsheet linked to the application. Without this file, the application would not be able to record any of the data. The token is safe to use on a secure shiny app server but be careful to never post the file anywhere publicly as it could be used to gain access to your google drive.
 - `roster.xlsx`: this excel file contains a template list of students and their team affiliations (more details below). Please modify this file by hand to fit your class so that the peer evaluation application knows which access codes are valid and can provide each student automatically with a prompt to evaluate each of their team mates. The application _never_ modifies this file (only you can modify it), it is used purely as a read-only data table.
 - `www/app.css`: this is a CSS stylesheet file that describes the stylistic formatting of the peer evaluation application. Modify this file to change colors, font sizes, etc (the basic style is the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) style). You may also include any other static files in the `www` folder that should be included in the application (e.g. image files).

For testing this new peer evaluation, feel free to jump straight to the [testing](#testing) section below.

### Roster

If you like the formatting and default text of the peer evaluation application, the roster is really the only file you need to edit. The template looks as follows:

```{r}
readxl::read_excel(file.path("peer eval 1", "roster.xlsx")) %>% 
  rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

As you can see, the excel sheet has only four columns, student last name (`last`), first name (`first`), individual unique access code (`access_code`) and team name (`team`). You may add additional columns to this spreadsheet if you would like to keep the information organized together (such as e.g. email addresses) but cannot omit these four. The first and last names are simply for the application to provide information to the students whose evaluation they are filling out (the last name is optional as seen in the example of *Marvin*). The team name must be identical between all team member so that the peer evaluation can identify each team correctly. The `access_code` can be any combination of letters, numbers and special characters that is unique across the whole roster as it allows each student to log into the peer evaluation (i.e. these access codes need to be conveyed to the students). To generate a random set of access codes, this package provides a convenience function to do so:

```{r}
tbl_generate_access_codes(n = 10, length = 6)
```

### Template

Once you have set up your first peer evaluation and adjusted all the text and formatting, you may want to use it as a template for future peer evaluations rather than starting from scratch each time. This is most easily accomplished by using the `tbl_duplicate_peer_evaluation` function instead of `tbl_setup_peer_evaluation`. Simply point the function to your previous peer evaluation folder (the template), specify the name of the new folder, and provide the name of the new google spreadsheet the application should be linked to (note that the spreadsheet should already exist so the new peer evaluation can make sure it has access to it).

```{r, include=FALSE}
# make sure to start from scratch (i.e. delete peer eval 2 folder if it exists)
if (dir.exists("peer eval 2")) unlink("peer eval 2", recursive = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tbl_duplicate_peer_evaluation(
  old_folder = "peer eval 1", new_folder = "peer eval 2", 
  data_gs_title = "class1234 peer evaluation 2")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# create actual peer evaluation folder without credentials checks
tbl_duplicate_peer_evaluation(
  template = "peer eval 1", folder = "peer eval 2", 
  data_gs_title = "class1234 peer evaluation 2", check_gs_access = FALSE)
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with authentication, run the following command to reset the google drive credentials and check that the google spreadsheet can be accessed:

```{r eval=FALSE}
tbl_check_gs_access(
  folder = "peer eval 1", 
  data_gs_title = "class1234 peer evaluation 1",
  new_credentials = TRUE)
```

For example, you may get the following error trying to test your peer evaluation application because of a problem with your authentication token (expired or for the wrong account):

```{r eval=FALSE}
tbl_test_peer_evaluation("peer eval 1")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tryCatch(
  tbl_test_peer_evaluation("peer eval 1"),
  error = function(e) cat(e$message)
)
```

Finally, if you ever want to start over from scratch, simply delete the created folder (or rename it) and run `tbl_setup_peer_evaluation()` again. 

For additional information on the `tbl_setup_peer_evaluation` (or any other tbltools function), please consult the package help with `?tbl_setup_peer_evaluation`.

## Testing

To test the peer evaluation appliation, simply use the `tbl_test_peer_evaluation` function, which launches the application on an adhoc local server on your own computer. Keep in mind that although the test application run just on your computer, it already writes data to the google spreadsheet! This is good for testing purposes (see what gets generated in your google spreadsheet) but make sure to delete any test records from the google spreadsheet that may interfere with students' peer evaluations prior to providing the students with the link to the deployed peer evaluation app. For this reason, Many people keep at least one test person in the roster (or a whole test team) to make testing easier.

```{r eval=FALSE}
tbl_test_peer_evaluation("peer eval 1")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tryCatch(
  tbl_test_peer_evaluation("peer eval 1"),
  error = function(e) { return(invisible(NULL)) }
)
# not actually launching so the vignette doesn't get stuck, but good
# to show what it looks like
cat("Info: looking for spreadsheet... Sheet successfully identified: \"class1234 peer evaluation 1\"

Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3683

```

### Login

The following is a screenshot of the login screen for the peer evaluation application. Note that you can change, for example, the displayed title with the `app_title` parameter in the `app.R` application file.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", out.extra='style="border: 2px solid black;"'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("images", "pe_login.png"))
```

### Welcome

Upon succesful login - here from the example student *Homer Simpson* who is part of the template `roster.xlsx`, the student sees a welcome message with their team name listed and welcome text that can be modified in the `app_welcome.md` file. Note that the default instructions also describe how students can save their peer evaluations and resume editing them at a later point (logging in with the same access code), only once they submit their answers they become final.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", out.extra='style="border: 2px solid black;"'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("images", "pe_welcome.png"))
```

### Evaluation

After the welcome message, the student is presented with a set of tabs for self evaluation (first tab), one tab for each team member (here *Spider Pig* and *Inigo Montoya* who are also part of *The Dream Team* as listed in the template `roster.xlsx`), and a final tab for quantitative scores. The self evaluation and team member tabs are essay questions for qualitative peer evaluation.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", out.extra='style="border: 2px solid black;"'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("images", "pe_evaluation.png"))
```

### Quantitative

The quantitative evaluations are provided on a separate tab as illustrated below and are subject to the constraints set through the parameters of the `tbl_run_peer_evaluation` function in the `app.R` application file (e.g. number of points per student, required difference in max and minimum assigned points if any, etc.).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", out.extra='style="border: 2px solid black;"'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("images", "pe_quant.png"))
```

## Deployment

To make your peer evaluation application available to the students, it needs to be deployed on a server the students havde access to (i.e. not just on your own computer). You or your university may run its own shiny server in which case they can simply host your application folder (i.e. the `peer eval 1` folder) on it. However, more commonly, the easiest approach is using RStudio's free [shiny apps](http://www.shinyapps.io/) service. Once you have an account, you need to install the rsconnect package (`install.packages('rsconnect')`) and configure your shinyapps credentials (`rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name="<ACCOUNT>", token="<TOKEN>", secret="<SECRET>")`). For a detailed guide, see [this configuration help](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html#configure-rsconnect). Once your credentials are set, simply call the `tbl_deploy_peer_evaluation` function to upload your peer evaluation app to the shinyapps server. Note that you can also use the `rsconnect::deployApp` function directly, or launch the test application (`tbl_test_peer_evaluation`) and click the **Publish** button in the upper right corner.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tbl_deploy_peer_evaluation(folder = "peer eval 1")
```


## Data Evaluation

Once your students have filled out their peer evaluations, you can pull the data directly from the google spreadsheet by hand or with your own script. The tbltools package provides some convenience functions for frequent data evaluation operations, such as summarizing the data by student. The `evaluation.Rmd` template file in your peer evaluation app folder provides a good starting point for this. Here we show with an example google spreadsheet how the data aggregation functions work and what the evaluation summaries look like and how to export them easily to an Excel spreadsheet for further processing.

### Fetch data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pe_data <- tbl_fetch_peer_evaluation_data(data_gs_title = "class1234 peer evaluation 1")
pe_data %>% rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pe_data <- 
  tbl_fetch_peer_evaluation_data(
    data_gs_key = tbl_example_peer_evaluation(),
    roster = tbl_example_roster()
  )
pe_data %>% rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

### Summarize evaluations

```{r}
pe_data %>% tbl_summarize_peer_evaluation_data(submitted_only = FALSE) %>% 
  rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

### Export to Excel

```{r}
pe_data %>% tbl_export_peer_evaluation_data(submitted_only = FALSE)
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
unlink("peer eval 1", recursive = TRUE)
unlink("peer eval 2", recursive = TRUE)
```
